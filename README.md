### 🎯 What Makes Colony Simulator Different?

- **3D**: I want to take the joy of Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress and take it to 3D
- **High Fantasy**: I am a simple person, I love Elves, Dwarfs, Magic, Orcs, Monsters and Dragons
- More to add at a later date

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

BulletFun is designed around three core principles:

1. **Active Engagement** - Players should constantly make meaningful decisions, not watch auto-attacks
2. **Strategic Depth** - Ability combinations and timing create emergent gameplay
3. **Satisfying Progression** - Both short-term (run-based) and long-term (meta) rewards
